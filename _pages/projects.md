### Parser LL(1) for textile procedures
- Implementation of a compiler with c++ that has a lexer and a parser to analysize chains that represent a textile flow resulting in a console interactive application that allows the user to verify a flow, review lexic errors and get information about the gramatic and the LL table.
- Compiler features:
    - Detect lexic, syntactic and other errors.
    - Extract and explore, this enables the compiler to analyze a flow after detecting a syntactic error.
    - Provide the correct version of a chain with lexic errors.
    - Generic code for first and follow sets and handler.
