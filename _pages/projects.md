Results:
- Completed the analysis and coumentation of the business, including the Business Model Canvas, SWOT, Process Flow Diagram and Business Analysis Process Flow.
- Designed of business strategies based on their needs and develop complete documentation of it.
- Created the routing algorithm, travel sequence and pricing algorithm to optimize the tranportation and reduce costs.
- Identify the semantic rules and designed the entity-relationship diagram and relational model led to the successful creation of the database.
- Functional and non-functional requirements identification and design of use case diagrams and platform mockup, considering the following features: registration and login, account recovery, travel request, payment, trip and user Profile.

### Remolques Tramontana DB design and implementation
Consulting project with a real company called Remolques Tramontana. The project consisted in the analysis of the business to design and implement their database and then optimize their more important queries using indexes and other strategies. The company operates in the field of manufacture, repair and rental of trailers and semi-trailers for general cargo.
- Identify semantic rules to design the entity-relationship diagram and relational model led to the successful creation of the database.
- Recognized and created the most important queries, which where optimized with the use of different indexes using PostgreSQL that resulted in a succesfull experimentation of the queries that proved the correctness ans usability of the optimized queries with large data.

### Parser LL(1) for textile procedures
- Implementation of a compiler with c++ that has a lexer and a parser to analysize chains that represent a textile flow resulting in a console interactive application that allows the user to verify a flow, review lexic errors and get information about the gramatic and the LL table.
- Compiler features:
    - Detect lexic, syntactic and other errors.
    - Extract and explore, this enables the compiler to analyze a flow after detecting a syntactic error.
    - Provide the correct version of a chain with lexic errors.
    - Generic code for first and follow sets and handler.
